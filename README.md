## Challenges During Development
<details>
<summary><strong>Challenge:</strong> User Authentication and Displaying Usernames</summary>
<br>
While integrating the front-end with my API, I encountered a challenge when attempting to display the logged-in user's username on the dashboard. To address this, I undertook the task of refactoring the LoginResponse class to include a user object alongside the JWT token. This allowed me to extract the username from the response, which now contained the user object. 

<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Challenge:</strong> Data Serialization </summary>
<br>
While building my full-stack application, I encountered a data serialization bug. The frontend was sending an object containing an array of options, but the backend was expecting a single option object. This mismatch caused an issue known as "HttpMessageNotReadableException" â€“ basically, the server couldn't read the message.

<br>
To fix this, I had to align the data format on both sides. This involved debugging and adjusting the code on the backend to ensure the data matched. In the end, this resolved the communication problem between the frontend and backend.

<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Challenge:</strong> JWT Token Refresh for Real-Time Updates</summary>
<br>
I encountered a challenging bug where the decisions displayed on the UI were not updating according to the currently logged-in user. Realized the root cause was stale JWT tokens in the HTTP headers used by the DecisionService. 

<br>
To resolve this, I integrated a dynamic header retrieval method within AuthService to fetch the most recent JWT token from local storage. This ensured that each HTTP request carried the latest token, aligning the fetched decisions with the current user session. Implementing this not only fixed the issue but also improved the application's overall data consistency and security.
</details>

## Conclusion ðŸŽ‰

Building the Impactful Decisions app has been a rewarding journey, filled with challenges and triumphs. My aim was to empower users in a world where decisions are constant. I envisioned a user-friendly platform that structures decision-making, from defining decisions and criteria to comparing options and analyzing pros and cons.

Throughout this project, I focused on user empowerment, user-friendliness, and structured decision-making. I implemented features like user registration and login for personalization, and created a step-by-step wizard-like interface to guide users.

Planning and project documentation set the foundation, and GitHub Projects kept me on track. User-Centric Design guided feature development, and wireframes ensured a user-friendly interface. Backend development with Spring Boot provided infrastructure, while Angular delivered a dynamic UI. I emphasized responsive design and intuitive navigation. Despite challenges like user authentication, data serialization, and JWT token refresh, I found solutions that contributed to the project's growth.

I've achieved my goal of providing a platform for impactful decisions. Thanks to all who supported me, including instructors, classmates, and family.

Thanks for joining me on this journey! ðŸš€
